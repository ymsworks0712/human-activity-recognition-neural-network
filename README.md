# Human Activity Recognition using Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using a Neural Network model trained on the UCF-101 dataset. Video frames are extracted, preprocessed, flattened, and classified using a fully connected deep neural network built with PyTorch.

## 🧠 Model & Techniques
- Dataset: UCF-101 (subset of 5 classes)
- Frame extraction using OpenCV
- Grayscale + resize preprocessing
- Fully Connected Neural Network
- PyTorch deep learning framework

## 📂 Classes Used
- ApplyEyeMakeup
- Archery
- BabyCrawling
- Basketball
- PullUps

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab
2. Mount Google Drive
3. Download UCF-101 dataset
4. Update dataset path
5. Run all cells sequentially

## 🎯 Result
Achieved activity classification accuracy on test dataset and can predict activity from unseen video samples.
